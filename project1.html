            <p>This project adds program and adjusts the 
                landscape of Bartram Gardens - an existing 
                historical home and gardens open to the 
                public. The new buildings/programs include 
                greenhouses, an exhibition and classroom 
                space, lab, an inn, event space, and a 
                boathouse with a new dock. These new 
                programs, which aim to further engage the 
                community with the gardens, are connected 
                by a continuous, covered walkway that 
                loosely follows the topography to stay a 
                consistant level. Inspired by the Japanese 
                engawa, the walkway serves as a transitional 
                space that connects the people to nature 
                in all weather. The North half sits semi-underground and transitions to the Southern 
                half that sits above ground with the preserved 
                historic core in the center. With a variety of 
                nature experiences - open meadow, dense 
                forest, green field, and wetlands - a guest 
                is able to immerse themselves in each one 
                alone the walkway</p>
