            My name is Eva Jungermann, and I am a fourth-year architecture student at Drexel University. 
            I grew up in St. Louis, Missouri before moving to Philadelphia for college where I was able to meet new people in a variety of fields and explore a new city. 
            With both of my parents having jobs in the creative field, my mom in graphic design and dad in architecture, I grew up interested in art and other creative activities. 
            I was drawn to architecture because of its mesh of math, logic, and creativity, and my goal is to create beautiful and usable buildings that with make others drawn to architecture like I was.

            When I am not working on projects for school, I enjoy doing crafts, sketching, dancing, and ice skating. 
            I competed in both synchronized and individual ice skating from elementary school to high school and still skate recreationally when I have time. 
            I had the opportunity to visit Barcelona last summer with Drexel where we sketched almost every location we visited. 
            I really enjoyed spending the time to admire each building, and the sketchbook is very fun to look back at as a way to remember the trip.

            My current school project is a large scale development project in South Philadelphia where an industrial site currently sits. 
            I am looking forward to developing my ideas and programming the open spaces. 
            Being the largest scale project I've worked on, I'm intimidated yet excited to see my final project.
